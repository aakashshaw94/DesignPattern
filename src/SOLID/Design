üöÄ What is SOLID?
‚úÖ SOLID is an acronym for 5 object-oriented design principles, aimed at:
-Writing clean, modular code
-Making code easier to maintain and scale
-Reducing bugs due to tight coupling and poor design

üì¶ What Does SOLID Stand For?
Principle	                      Meaning	                                Purpose
S - Single Responsibility	      A class should have only                  Improves cohesion, reduces complexity
                                  one reason to change

O - Open/Closed	                  Software entities should be open          Allows adding features without touching
                                  for extension but closed for              existing code
                                  modification

L - Liskov Substitution	          Subclasses should be replaceable          Ensures polymorphism works correctly
                                  for their base class

I - Interface Segregation	      Don't force clients to depend on          Encourages small, specific interfaces
                                  unused interfaces

D - Dependency Inversion	      Depend on abstractions, not on            Promotes decoupled, flexible code through
                                  concretions	                            interfaces


üß± What Are Design Patterns?
‚úÖ Design Patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design.
They are:
-Reusable templates
-Language-independent
-Not code you copy-paste, but ideas you implement


üéØ Purpose of Design Patterns:
Purpose	                            Description
Solve common design problems	    Like object creation (Factory), structure (Adapter), behavior (Observer)

Improve reusability	                Well-structured and decoupled components

Provide shared language	            Easier to communicate design with other developers


üÜö SOLID vs Design Patterns
Aspect	                    SOLID Principles	                    Design Patterns
Definition	                Set of 5 object-oriented                Reusable solutions to recurring design problems
                            design principles

Purpose	                    Guide how to design classes             Help you solve specific problems in flexible ways
                            and interfaces

Scope	                    More conceptual, principle-driven	    More implementation-focused, tactical

When Used	                While designing the structure and       While solving design problems like object creation,
                            responsibility of classes	            communication, structure, etc.

Example	                    "One class should only have one         "Use Strategy pattern to switch algorithms at runtime"
                            reason to change"


üîß Example:
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a payment system.

Using SOLID:

-You keep the PaymentService focused only on handling payments (SRP).

-You depend on an IPaymentMethod interface (DIP, ISP).

-You can add new payment types without modifying the existing logic (OCP).

Using Design Pattern:

-You implement the Strategy Pattern to inject the correct payment algorithm at runtime.

üß† In short:

SOLID tells you how to structure your code (principles).

Design Patterns give you reusable solutions (tools) to implement those principles.




üîÅ Think of it like this:
SOLID is about design philosophy.
Design Patterns are about design execution.
