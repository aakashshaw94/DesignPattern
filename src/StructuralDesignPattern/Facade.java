/**
 *
 *
 * ‚úÖ Definition:
 * The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
 *
 *
 * üéØ In Simple Words:
 * üëâ Facade = Simplifier.
 * It hides the complexity of multiple systems behind one easy-to-use interface.
 *
 *
 * üì¶ Real-World Backend Example:
 * User Registration Workflow in Backend
 * When you register a new user:
 * You need to:
 *
 * -Save user data to the database.
 *
 * -Send a welcome email.
 *
 * -Log the registration activity.
 *
 * -Create a user profile.
 *
 * üëâ Normally, you would need to call each of these services individually.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Facade Pattern simplifies this:
 *
 * -You provide one method: registerUser()
 *
 * -The Facade internally calls all the complex subsystems.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * üí° Real Backend Parallel:
 * In Spring Boot: Service classes often act as facades over repositories, mailers, loggers, etc.
 *
 * Payment Gateways: Provide simple payment APIs but internally deal with multiple processors.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Let‚Äôs Build It: User Registration Facade
 *

    /**
     *
     *
     * ‚úÖ Key Takeaways:
     * Concept	        Explanation
     * -------------------------------------------------------------
     * Facade	        UserRegistrationFacade simplifies complex workflow
     * Subsystems	    UserDatabaseService, EmailService, LoggingService, ProfileService
     * Benefit	        Client only needs to call one method to complete registration
     *
     * üéØ Real Backend Use Cases:
     * User Authentication/Registration Services: Usually facades that orchestrate DB, Email, Logging, Profile creation.
     *
     * Payment Processing: Facade calls tokenization, fraud check, payment API, confirmation mail.
     *
     * E-commerce Checkout: One method that internally calls inventory, payment, shipping, and order services.
     *
     * Spring Security: Facade over complex authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT, sessions, etc.).
     *
     * ‚úÖ Why This Example is Realistic:
     * ‚úîÔ∏è Backend developers orchestrate workflows all the time.
     * ‚úîÔ∏è Real services are often composed of smaller services.
     * ‚úîÔ∏è Facade makes your code clean, simple, and easy to maintain.
     * ‚úîÔ∏è Promotes low coupling: clients don‚Äôt know or care about internal service details.
     *
     * üî• When to Use Facade:
     * When you want to hide system complexity.
     *
     * When you need to provide a unified API.
     *
     * When you want to reduce coupling between client code and the subsystem.
     *
