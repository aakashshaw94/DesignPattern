/**
 *
 *
 * ‚úÖ Definition:
 * The Flyweight Pattern is used to minimize memory usage by sharing common objects instead of creating new ones each time.
 *
 * üéØ In Simple Words:
 * üëâ Flyweight = Shared Objects.
 * It avoids creating duplicate objects when many objects can share the same intrinsic data.
 *
 * üì¶ Real-World Backend Example: Database Connection Pooling
 * üîî Problem:
 * In a backend system:
 *
 * -You need many database connections.
 *
 * -Creating a new connection every time is very costly.
 *
 * -Solution: You reuse (share) existing connections from a pool.
 *
 * ‚úÖ This is a perfect example of the Flyweight Pattern.
 *
 * üí° Real Backend Parallel:
 * -JDBC Connection Pooling
 *
 * -Thread Pools
 *
 * -String Pooling in Java (String.intern())
 *
 * -Caching Systems (like Ehcache, Redis key sharing)
 *
 * ‚úÖ Let‚Äôs Build It: Database Connection Pool (Flyweight Example)

     *
     * ‚úÖ Key Takeaways:
     * Concept	            Explanation
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Flyweight	        DatabaseConnection (shared object)
     * Factory	            ConnectionPool (manages and reuses shared objects)
     * Client	            Requests connections, but shared ones are reused
     *
     * üéØ Real Backend Use Cases:
     * Database Connection Pools (HikariCP, Apache DBCP)
     *
     * Thread Pools
     *
     * Object Caching (Redis, Memcached)
     *
     * String Interning in Java
     *
     * Rendering Systems: Sharing icons, fonts, or styles.
     *
     * ‚úÖ Why This Example is Realistic:
     * ‚úîÔ∏è Backend developers rely on connection pools in nearly every application.
     * ‚úîÔ∏è Connection pool managers use Flyweight Pattern under the hood.
     * ‚úîÔ∏è Helps optimize memory and performance when creating many heavy objects.
     *
     * üî• When to Use Flyweight:
     * When you have lots of similar objects.
     *
     * When the cost of creating objects is high.
     *
     * When most of the object‚Äôs data can be shared (intrinsic) and only a small part changes per request (extrinsic).
     *
     * ‚úÖ Bonus:
     * Intrinsic State vs Extrinsic State:
     * Intrinsic (shared): Connection details like ID.
     *
     * Extrinsic (unique): Specific query or transaction details (not stored in the flyweight).
     *
