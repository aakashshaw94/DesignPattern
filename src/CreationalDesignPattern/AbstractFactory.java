/**
 * âœ… Definition:
 * The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface to create families of related objects without specifying their
 * concrete classes.
 *
 * ðŸ‘‰ In Simple Words:
 * Itâ€™s a factory of factories.
 * It creates related objects together (like a set or family).
 *
 * ðŸ“¦ Real-Life Example:
 * ðŸŽ® Gaming Theme Example:
 * Suppose you are making a game that has two themes:
 *
 * Futuristic World âžœ Creates Futuristic Vehicles & Weapons
 *
 * Medieval World âžœ Creates Horses & Swords
 *
 * You need a system that creates:
 *
 * Vehicle + Weapon for each world (family of products).
 *
 * Thatâ€™s where Abstract Factory fits perfectly!
 *
 * ðŸŽ¯ Quick Summary:
 * Concept	                        Description
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * What	                            Factory of factories:Creates related objects without specifying their classes.
 * Why	                            Keeps object families consistent, makes switching themes easy.
 * When	                            When objects must be used together and you want to easily switch families.
 * Use Cases	                    UI themes, Game worlds, Cross-platform tools.
 *
 * ðŸ†š Difference Between Factory Method & Abstract Factory:
 * Feature	        Factory Method	        Abstract Factory
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Creates	        One Product	            Multiple related products (family)
 * Structure	    Single factory	        Factory of factories
 * Complexity	    Simple	                More structured and scalable
