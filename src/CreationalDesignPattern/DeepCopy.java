/**
 *
 * ‚úÖ What is Deep Cloning?
 * Shallow Cloning: Copies the object but not the nested (referenced) objects.
 *
 * Deep Cloning: Copies the object and all nested objects (so changes to one do not affect the other at any level).
 *
 * ‚úÖ Why Serialization Works Well?
 * Serialization writes the entire object graph to a stream and reads it back ‚Äî effectively creating a deep copy.
 *
 * üí° Simple Example: Deep Cloning via Serialization
 * Let‚Äôs say we have a Student with an Address object inside it.
 *
 * üéØ Key Points:
 * ‚úÖ Deep cloning achieved!
 *
 * Changing the original object does not affect the clone, even for nested objects.
 *
 * Serialization automatically takes care of deep copying complex objects.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Benefits of Deep Cloning via Serialization:
 * Very simple to implement.
 *
 * Works for deeply nested objects.
 *
 * Ensures full object separation.
 *
 * ‚ö° Caution:
 * All classes must implement Serializable.
 *
 * Performance can be slower for very large objects.
 *
 * For high-performance cases, manual deep cloning is better.
 *
 * üî• Summary Table:
 * Feature	                            Shallow Clone	            Deep Clone via Serialization
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Copies top-level fields	                ‚úÖ	                                ‚úÖ
 * Copies nested objects	        ‚ùå (references are shared)	    ‚úÖ (completely new copies of nested objects)
 * Implementation	                  clone() + Cloneable	            Serialization-based deep copy
 * Recommended for	                    Simple objects	                    Complex, nested objects
