Focus: Object Creation Mechanisms
Purpose: Deal with object creation problems by controlling the creation process to suit the situation.

List of Creational Patterns:

Design Pattern	        Purpose
--------------------------------------------------------------
Singleton	            Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.

Factory Method	        Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects
                        that will be created.

Abstract Factory	    Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without
                        specifying their concrete classes.

Builder	                Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same
                        construction process can create different representations.

Prototype	            Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new
                        objects by copying this prototype.
