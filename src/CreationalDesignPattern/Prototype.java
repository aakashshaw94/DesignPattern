/**
 *
 * ‚úÖ Definition:
 * The Prototype Pattern is used to create a copy (clone) of an existing object instead of creating a new one from scratch.
 *
 * üëâ In simple words:
 * You make a duplicate of an object quickly.
 *
 * üéØ Why Use Prototype Pattern?
 * When creating a new object is expensive or time-consuming.
 *
 * When you need many similar objects.
 *
 * üì¶ Real-Life Example:
 * Imagine you have a Resume template.
 *
 * Instead of making a new resume from zero every time, you just make a copy and update your details.
 *
 * üî• What Happened?
 * ‚úîÔ∏è Original object created.
 * ‚úîÔ∏è Clone made directly without using new keyword to create a fresh object.
 * ‚úîÔ∏è Both are separate objects (modifying one does not affect the other unless it‚Äôs a deep clone).
 *
 * ‚úÖ Key Points:
 * Concept	                    Description
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Purpose	                    Copy an existing object quickly.
 * How	                        Using the clone() method or copy constructors.
 * When	                        When object creation is costly or you need many similar objects.
 * Example in Java	            ArrayList.clone(), HashMap.clone(), Prototype beans in Spring.
 *
 * üìå Bonus:
 * üëâ Java Clone Types:
 * Shallow Copy: Copies only top-level fields (like our example).
 *
 * Deep Copy: Copies all nested objects (more advanced but safer for complex objects).
 *
 * ‚úÖ Summary:
 * Prototype = Copy object quickly.
 *
 * Use when creating new objects is expensive.
 *
 * In Java: Achieved using Cloneable interface and clone() method.
